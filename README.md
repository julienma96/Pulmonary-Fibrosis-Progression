# Pulmonary-Fibrosis-Progression
OSIC Pulmonary Fibrosis Progression\
Predict lung function decline

>Imagine one day, your breathing became consistently labored and shallow.\
>Months later you were finally diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis, \
>a disorder with no known cause and no known cure, created by scarring of the lungs. \
>If that happened to you, you would want to know your prognosis. \
>That’s where a troubling disease becomes frightening for the patient: \
>outcomes can range from long-term stability to rapid deterioration, \
>but doctors aren’t easily able to tell where an individual may fall on that spectrum. \
>Your help, and data science, may be able to aid in this prediction, \
>which would dramatically help both patients and clinicians.

**This is a Kaggle Competition.** \

**Whats to come?** \
*Another notebook will be uploaded soon, I am currently busy with exams.* \
I noticed that the data is way too big to fit in 16GB RAM\
That's why I'm going to use Tensorflow's Data API to run the Functional Keras model. \
The model itself consists of a MLP branch and a CNN branch and will take multiple inputs and have multiple outputs
